TODO:
[] grass
[] boss that walks around and destroys floor tiles.
[] add gravity well after wave 8

[] Sticky/slippery tiles
[] Arrows spawn to fire at areas where player idles a lot
[] Moving in grass / cutting grass makes bigger grass

[] play area gets bigger every X levels.

8 waves
Grass cut particles
Flowers cut particles

High pass filter when a bomb goes off.

IDEAS: 
* Rapid fire, smaller weapon with small kick back.
* Slower & bigger weapon with larger kick back
* Pulse shield that pushes enemies away & into traps
* Boomerang weapon
- Slug you killed by standing on them come back as bad-ass-motherfuckers.
- Destroying flowers become dangerous pirhanna plants.
